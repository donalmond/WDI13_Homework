  <h2>The Life and Times of Grace Hopper.</h2>
  <p> When Grace Murray was born on the 9th of December in 1906, computers were a pipedream and when Admiral Doctor Grace Hopper died on the 1st January 1991, the internet was in its infancy. She isn't responsible for all that work, but she's responsible for a remarkably large part of it.</p>

  <p> Initially training as a mathematician, and obtaining a masters in 1930, the same year she married her husband, Vincent Hopper (who died in 1945). Four years later, she earnt a doctorate from Yale with a thesis titled "New Types of Irreducibility Criteria" (which is about when you can and can't factorise polynomials). In 1943 she joined the US Navy to assist in her countries war effort. This was her third application. </p>

  <p> At that time the Manhattan Project was well underway, and a device was being built to do the calculations required by this effort, known as the Mark 1. At the age of 37, Grace Hopper learnt how to program the new machine and was just the third person to do so. This experience was clearly a seminal moment in her life, and began her struggle to make computers work, not just the military establishment, but for the broader community and especially for programers.</p>

  <p>In 1949, she moved on to UNIVAC-1, the first large digital computer (that's right, the Mark 1 was analog, think about that). It was on that machine that Hopper began to make the work of programers easier, by encouraging people to share their programs, so that people could reuse each others good ideas (ie Grace Hopper thought of Stack Overflow in the early fifties).</p>

  <p>She then wrote the A-O compiler, which used call numbers to refer to predefined routines found on the programming tape. This is very much how our modern functions work. The establishment was pretty anti A-O, but Hopper went ahead anyway, more or less inventing "Its better to ask forgiveness than permission" which is a philosophy used by the error handling in a few modern languages.</p>

  <p>Later, she wrote the FLOW-MATIC compiler, the first compiler to use english like statements in code and to separate the instructions and the data being operated on into two separate classes.</p>

  <p>In 1959, she was one of the two technical advisers to the CODASYL committee which designed the COBOL computing language, based on FLOW-MATIC, widely seen as the first "plain english" computing language. She was also a significant driver behind the effort to ensure different COBOL compilers made functionally the same code. Code portability is probably the most important feature that we all want on our pages, so its pretty cool that someone involved in early computing efforts was also aware of how powerful this idea was. </p>

  <p> Grace Hopper has made a significant contribution to all our lives, both in concrete and philosophical ways.</p>
